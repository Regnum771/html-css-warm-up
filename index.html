   <h3>Album Background</h3>
      <p>The three guys in Brooklyn’s Dawn of Midi play a grand piano, an upright contrabass, and a drum kit — the same instrumentation used in traditional jazz piano trios. But it’s tricky to say where Dawn of Midi’s new album Dysnomia fits within the jazz pantheon, if it even fits in there at all. Unlike their minimalist free jazz debut First, Dawn of Midi meticulously scripted and scored Dysnomia. For 46 continuous minutes, the trio inverts free jazz into bound jazz, torturing their instruments by playing as few notes as humanly possible. They write barely-there melodies that chase their own tails. They establish mercurial rhythms that are confusingly simple — three humans dovetailing instrumental loops into thousands of subtly different permutations. It sounds close to an acoustic Beak> session playing a Steve Reich composition, though even closer to something totally unprecedented.<p>
